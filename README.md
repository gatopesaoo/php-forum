# PHP Forum
This is an open sourcing of my old Php forum and as a FOSS Lover I figured I might open source it,
you are allowed to modify and redistribute my code freely just as long as the project is open source!

## Liscensing
In order to use my code you have to use the GPLv3 meaning you must
have any redistributed code opened source and link to it on the page, thanks!

Made with love, juls07!

# PHP Forum
This is an open sourcing of my old Php forum and as a FOSS Lover I figured I might open source it,
you are allowed to modify and redistribute my code freely just as long as the project is open source!

## Running
So you have done some editing to the code made it production stable or your trying to make it stable, great heres how you do that:
First you have to make a database, the first row should be an id field make sure its auto incrementing, next make a username field make it !NULL,
make a password field next make it !NULL and thats it. Next inside of connect.php put in your credentials and
thats, next you need to make a captia, then you need to actually run the php server simple enough then you've done it!

# Liscensing
In order to use my code you have to use the GPLv3 meaning you must
have any redistributed code opened source and link to it on the page, thanks!

Made with love, juls07!
